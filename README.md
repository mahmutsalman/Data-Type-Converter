# Data-Type-Converter
manipulation on bit-level representations of integers and floating point numbers

An application that takes:
* a file containing signed integers, unsigned integers and floating point numbers
* the byte ordering type (Little Endian or Big Endian)
* the size of the floating point data type (the size of both signed and
unsigned integers are 2 bytes)

The size of the data type can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes
